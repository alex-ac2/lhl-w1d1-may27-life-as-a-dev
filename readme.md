# Talking Calendar

We will be given a date as a string (not a Date object). The date will always be formatted as `YYYY/MM/DD`. We will have to parse the given string and produce a human readable date.

## Tasks

- Break down input into individual parts
- Year stays the same
- Month is converted to English name
- Day has a suffix appended to it
